## The Heavier the Growth, the Lower the Clarity

Most entrepreneurs believe that hitting the next revenue milestone—$50k, $100k, $1M—will solve their stress. But usually, it just amplifies the incoherence. 

When your business grows faster than your internal systems (and your internal sense of trust), it feels like riding a bike downhill with no brakes. You're moving fast, but you're not in control.

## What is Coherence?

Coherence is the state where your vision, your financial decisions, and your daily actions are all moving in the same direction. It is the opposite of friction.

> "Coherence is not the absence of growth; it is the foundation of growth that doesn't burn you out."

## How to Regain Stability

1. **Step Back from Urgency**: Most "emergencies" in business are actually just symptoms of poor alignment.
2. **Review Your Numbers**: Financial clarity is the ultimate grounding tool.
3. **Audit Your Alignment**: Is the work you're doing today actually building the business you want tomorrow?

By focusing on coherence, you turn your business back into a vehicle for leadership rather than a burden of reaction.
